Using a ML Decision Tree Classifier to predict sexual orientation based on data profile data

The current model performs with around 77% accuracy, which is problematic due to the fact that non-straight respondents comprise only 16% of the dataset. Essentially the model could randomly guess better at 84% accuracy. Resolving this may involve reducing the number of variables and keeping only the ones that are most tightly related to sexual orientation. The purpose of this project was to learn about approaching the workflow for ML problems and to illustrate the steps needed to examine, preprocess, and analyze data. It may even be the case that sexual orientation is not reliably related to any of the data in the dataset.
